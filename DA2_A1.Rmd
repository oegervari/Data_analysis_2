## Introduction

In this assignment I examine the gender wage gap difference in the [cps-earningsdatase](https://osf.io/g8p9j/) dataset. First I take a look at the unconditional gender gap, then I will attempt to how how the gender gap varies with the level education.

From the dataset I chose the 'Accountants and auditors' profession with occupation code 800.
